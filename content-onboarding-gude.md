### Overview

This guide provides and overview of how to use GitHub to upload new pages and contents/ update old ones onto the Singapore Government Developer Portal (Dev Portal).
Should you have any queries about publishing on the portal or in need of any help, you can contact us at <gds_developer_portal@tech.gov.sg>.
  
### Prerequisites

**GitHub Account Setup**

GitHub will be the main interface you will need to interact with, in order to publish your article. Please register for a GitHub account if you 
do not already have one. Listed below are the steps to register for one. Once you register the GitHub account, you can directly email us at
<gds_developer_portal@tech.gov.sg> your GitHub account name for us to add you to the developer portal. Alternatively, if you already have an existing account,
just drop us an email with you current account name so that we will grant the write access.

Head to <https://github.com/join>{:target="_blank"}, and sign up for an account using your preferred email address and professional username.

Upon successful signup, you should receive a Welcome email in the email address provided.
  
**GitHub 2FA Setup**

2-Factor Authentication (2FA) helps to ensure you GitHub account remains secure to attacks. Dev Portal requires users to have 2FA enabled in their accounts.  

Step 1: Click on your profile picture on the top right hand corner of the page, select "Settings" and await redirection.

Step 4: Select the desired 2FA authentication method. There is the option to choose either the use of a third-party application (Google Authenticator, Authy, LastPass, etc.)
or via and SMS message.

Step 6: Save the recovery codes in this step, which guaranteed the owner of the account in the event 2FA fails. It is strongly encouraged to store these codes securely.

### Page Creation

Before we get started on the publishing flow, let us define certain components of the Dev Portal.

- **Collection:** The top-level grouping of all documentations. There currently exists 4 main categories, namely Guidelines, Technologies, 
Singapore Government Tech Stack and Communities.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/page-creation-collection.png" width="70%" height="70%" alt="Fig 8: "/></p>
<p align="center">Fig 8: </p>

- **Sub-Collection:** In every collection, there are multiple sub-collections. These sub-collections act as groups for specific content.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/page-creation-sub-collection.png" width="70%" height="70%" alt="Fig 9: "/></p>
<p align="center">Fig 9: </p>

- **Documentation:** In every sub-collection, there are multiple documentations published by stakeholders. These documentation will be accessible by clicking on links in
left navigation bar and overview page as displayed below.

We are now ready to get started with publishing! Head over to <https://github.com/govtechsg/developer.gov.sg>. At this point, you should have received an email invitation
to the repository, allowing write access. You should also have been told which collection and sub-collection will the documentation be classified into.
