### Overview

Before we get started on the publishing flow, let us define certain components of the Dev Portal.

### Collection

The top-level grouping of all documentations. There currently exists 4 main categories, namely Guidelines, Technologies, 
Singapore Government Tech Stack and Communities.

### Sub-collection

In every collection, there are multiple sub-collections. These sub-collections act as groups for specific content.

We are now ready to get started with publishing!

Head over to [https://github.com/govtechsg/developer.gov.sg](https://github.com/govtechsg/developer.gov.sg ':target=_blank'). At this point, you should have received an 
email invitation to the repository, allowing write access. You should also have been told which collection and sub-collection will the documentation be classified into.
