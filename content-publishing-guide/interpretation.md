## Overview

Before we get started on the publishing flow, let us define certain components of the Dev Portal.

## Collection

The top-level grouping of all documentations. There currently exists 4 main categories, namely Guidelines, Technologies, 
Singapore Government Tech Stack and Communities.

## Sub-collection

In every collection, there are multiple sub-collections. These sub-collections act as groups for specific content.

## Documentation

In every sub-collection, there are multiple documentations published by stakeholders. These documentation will be accessible by clicking on links in
left navigation bar and overview page as displayed below.

We are now ready to get started with publishing!

Head over to [https://github.com/govtechsg/developer.gov.sg](https://github.com/govtechsg/developer.gov.sg ':target=_blank'). At this point, you should have received an 
email invitation to the repository, allowing write access. You should also have been told which collection and sub-collection will the documentation be classified into.
