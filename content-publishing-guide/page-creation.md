Step 1: Create a new branch to work on. This branch will contain all the work you will be doing.

Step 2: Uploading images to /assets/img/. Navigate to the directory and upload you files. Name the image files in this naming convention: product-name-alise.png (e.g. my-first-documentation-analytics-dashboard.png).

Step 4: Next, navigate to the designated folder you have been informed of. The directory will be in the format/collections/[COLLECTION_NAME]/[SUB-COLLECTION_NAME]. In this example it would be /collections/\_technologies/analytics.
